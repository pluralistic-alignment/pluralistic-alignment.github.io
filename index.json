Molecular solutions will be critical to addressing these global problems on scales of complexity never-before-seen. However, they exist in extremely large search spaces, which makes AI tools a necessity. Excitingly, the chemistry field is posed to be substantially accelerated via multimodal models combining language with molecules and drug structures.\nStay tuned by following us on Twitter @lang_plus_mols.\nOur tutorial material is being uploaded to Github.\nThe slides from the tutorial can be found on Github as well!\nTutorial Outline [180 min.] Applying language models to the scientific domain is becoming increasingly popular due to its potential impact for accelerating scientific discovery (Hope et al., 2022). Beyond extracting information from scientific literature, NLP has the possibility to increase control of the scientific discovery process, which can be achieved through multimodal representations and generative language models.\n1. Background [60 min.] Scientific Information Extraction [15 min.] To start, we will provide a high-level overview on traditional NLP tasks used for scientific discovery (e.g., named entity recognition, entity linking, and relation extraction), as well as recent domain-specific LLMs designed for superior performance on scientific tasks (Beltagy et al., 2019).\nWhat is a molecule? [15 min.] Half of the title is molecules, but what is one? We will start from scratch and discuss what a molecule actually is, including the basic constituents of molecules, atoms and bonds, and how they essentially form graph structures. Then, we will focus on molecular string languages, which are a key building block for chemical language models. We will discuss tradeoffs of these languages (Grisoni, 2023; Weininger, 1988; O’Boyle and Dalke, 2018; Krenn et al., 2020; Cheng et al., 2023). Krenn et al. (2020) proposes a formal grammar approach, which may particularly interest the ACL community.\nMolecule Design using Language Models [15 min.] Now that we know what a molecule is, we will overview recent work applying NLP techniques to these molecular languages with impressive results. LLMs are traineded with adapted pretraining techniques from (natural) language models to learn molecule representation from large collections of such molecule strings (Frey et al., 2022; Chithrananda et al., 2020; Ahmad et al., 2022; Fabian et al., 2020; Schwaller et al., 2021; NVIDIA Corporation, 2022; Flam-Shepherd and Aspuru-Guzik, 2023; Tysinger et al., 2023). Applications including molecule and material generation, property prediction, and protein binding site prediction.\nDrug Discovery – A Brief Primer [15 min.] Ok, so NLP is being used for molecules now. What can we do with it?—here, we present a brief overview of drug discovery–an important but challenging problem. Historically, molecular discovery has commonly been done by humans who design and build individual molecules, but this can cost over a billion dollars and take over ten years (Gaudelet et al., 2021). We’ll discuss a little of the process here, including non-NLP deep learning methods, so that we know how to improve it.\n2. Integrating Language with Molecules [95 min.] What does natural language have to offer? [15 min.] At least at first, integrating languages and molecules seems like an odd idea. Here, we’ll start an interactive discussion with the audience on what they think potential benefits might be. We’ll make sure to mention the following major advantages, as discussed in the recent survey (Zhang et al., 2023, Section 10.3.3 “Natural Language-Guided Scientific Discovery”):\nGenerative Modeling: One of the largest problems in current LLMs—hallucination—becomes a strength for discovering molecules with high-level functions and abstract properties. In particular, language is compositional by nature (Szabó, 2020; Partee et al., 1984; Han et al., 2023), and therefore holds promise for composing these high-level properties (e.g., antimalarial) (Liu et al., 2022). Bridging Modalities: Language can serve to “bridge” between modalities for scarce data. Domain Understanding: Grounding language models into external real world knowledge can improve understanding of unseen molecules and advance many emerging tasks, such as experimental procedure planning, which use LLMs as scientific agents. Democratization: Language enables scientists without computational expertise to leverage advances in scientific AI.
